# eslint-config-awzzm
> ESLint configurations for TypeScript, Node.js, Vue.js (v3) and NuxtJS (v3)

First rule: Rules should support you, not slow you down.

See the corresponding files for the different configurations:

:yellow_heart: **[Base (TypeScript)](/packages/base)**

:green_heart: **[Vue.js (v3) and NuxtJS (v3)](/packages/vue)**

:purple_heart: **[Node.js](/packages/node)**

> Note: You don't need to install the base if you want to use a more specific configuration.
